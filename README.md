# NoisyMix: Boosting Model Robustness and In-domain Accuracy

\textit{NoisyMix} is a training scheme that combines data augmentations with stability training and noise injections. Models trained with \textit{NoisyMix} generalize better and show to be more robustnes to common currptions. Compared the other data augementation schemes, the advantage is substantial when models are evlauated on ImageNet-C, and ImageNet-R as shown by the following figure.
